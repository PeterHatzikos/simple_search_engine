# simple_search_engine
## Introduction
The following is a simple search engine for a set number of random <b>wikipedia</b> articles . The engine allows users to make queries and retrive relevant articles based on various search algorithms . The program includes a web crawler that fetches the usuable text from the wikipedia articles , and it can support the Boolean Search , Vector Space Model and Probabilistic Retrival search algorithms .

## features 
* <u>Web Crawler :</u>  The program includes a web crawler that fetches the usuable text from the wikipedia articles.
* <u>Search Algorithms:</u>
  * <b>Boolean Search:</b> Supports queries with Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) for more refined searches.
  * <b>Vector Space Model:</b> Utilizes TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and cosine similarity for searching and ranking.
  * <b>Probabilistic Retrieval:</b> Uses the BM25 algorithm to calculate scores and rank documents.
 
 ## Directory Structure
 * programs : contains the programs/functions of the system .
 * data : holds the results from the systems execution .
